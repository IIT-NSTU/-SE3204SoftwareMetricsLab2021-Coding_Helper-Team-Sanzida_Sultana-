Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
Coding_Helper,code_clone,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: code_clone; console
Coding_Helper,code_clone,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: code_clone; console; metrices; searching
Coding_Helper,code_clone,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BoxAndWhiskerChart; CloneCheck; CosineSimilarity; TfIdfCalculate; getTfIdf]; [Porter_stemmer; PreProcessing]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29
